## üîç Steps and Process

1. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Check for NULL values and handle missing data.
   - Load the data into a MySQL database and create tables.
   - Filter columns with null values and verify data integrity.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Add columns like `time_of_day` (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Evening) to analyze time-based sales patterns.
   - Extract day of the week (`day_name`) to understand weekly sales trends.
   - Extract month (`month_name`) to identify monthly performance variations.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conduct EDA to answer specific project questions and meet analysis goals.
